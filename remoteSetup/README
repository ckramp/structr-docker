Requirements:
	- docker
	- docker-compose
	- Existance of the following folder in the docker-compose.yml directory:
		- ./mount/
		- ./mount/structr
		- ./mount/neo4j

Preperations:
	- Structr
		- Before building the image, the following Structr files should be prepared
			- structr.conf : ./structr/bootstrap/structr.conf
			- license.key : ./structr/bootstrap/license.key

Usage:
	Initial optional setup / image rebuild:
		docker-compose build
	
	Starting the instances:
		docker-compose up -d

	Stopping the instances:
		docker-compose down

	Inspecting the containers
		1. docker ps
		2. Note the container id
		3. docker exec -it <Unique identifier for container> /bin/sh

	Mounted volumes
		Both instances expose their mounted files as volumes under their respective ./mount/ path
		- neo4j: ./mount/neo4j
		- structr: ./mount/structr
