Structr - Neo4j Causal Clustering Setup

1. Setup
	docker-compose build
2. Starting the instances
	docker-compose up -d

	- This will take a while and once ready the following web interfaces will be exposed:

		localhost:8082 - Structr
		localhost:7474 - Neo4j CC Node 1
		localhost:7475 - Neo4j CC Node 2
		localhost:7476 - Neo4j CC Node 3

		!! Warning !!

		When accessing Node2 and Node3 the default bolt-Ports need to be changed in the web interface before connecting

		Bolt Ports:
		localhost:7687 - Neo4j CC Node1
		localhost:7688 - Neo4j CC Node2
		localhost:7689 - Neo4j CC Node3


3. Connecting to the instances

	- Get the container id
		docker ps

	- Connect to the container
		docker exec -it [id] /bin/sh

	- Alternatively attach to the container
		docker attach [id]

			- Attaching to the structr instance right after the docker-compose up command, gives direct log output similar to run_debug.sh

	- Copy files, e.g. log out of the container
		docker cp [id]:[filePath] [destination]

4. Stopping the cluster
	docker-compose down
